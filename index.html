        I love learning new things in the field of computer science. I want to innovate in order help people and I can't wait to do that.
        I love meeting new people and making new friends. I believe that having a positive attitude helps me thorough out my day so I love to smile a lot.
        A hobby of mine is listening to music such as classics and scores. I am currently developing myself, learning my mistakes from my past and doing my best to improve myself for the future.
